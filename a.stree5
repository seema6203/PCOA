Methods:
Analysis was performed using SplitsTree5 5.0.0_alpha (Huson 1998, Huson and Bryant 2006).
The original input consisted of 0 taxa and a 3x3 distance matrix.
The Neighbor Net method (Bryant & Moulton 2004) was used (default options) so as to obtain 0 splits.
The Splits Network Algorithm method (Dress & Huson 2004) was used (default options) so as to obtain .
